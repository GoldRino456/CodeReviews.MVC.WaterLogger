## Lessons Learned

- This is my first web app built using ASP.NET and Razor pages. Thankfully, I've come into this with some prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. Being able to weave C# code directly into HTML was a little strange for me at first, but really neat none the less.
- Learning the link between page and controller, at least how Razor handles that, took me a bit to wrap my head around. It now is really clear that HTTP methods are part of the controller (GET, PUT, POST, etc.) and have corresponding "on___" methods that can be used. Anything else would need to be explicity called somewhere in the view.
